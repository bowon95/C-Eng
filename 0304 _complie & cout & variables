Many functions in C++ are wrapped with a namespace called 'std'. Meaning 'standard.'
In C++, it's not allowed to have a same variable names. 

cout : output values/ print text.
cout is in std namespace, so use ::(scope resolution operator).

So, std::cout means cout in std. 
If you have made a variable name 'cout', 
which is different to std::cout.

/*
Basic knowledge of Computer.***

When the program is executed, the data is saved in the computer memory.
computer memory : primary(= main memory)
HDD or SSD : secondary memory(= auxiliary memory)

primary memory : primary memory holds the data on which the computer is currently working. 
                 The data will be lost when power is switched off.
secondary memory : Data is permanently stored even if power is switched off.

'bit' is smallest unit of storage. ***
1byte : 8bits
1kbyte : 1024bytes
1mbyte : 1024kbytes
1gbyte : 1024mbytes
1tbyte : 1024gbytes

1bit : can take a value of 0,1.
1byte can handle up to 256 (2^8).

In C++ you can save the data using variables. 

True/False : 0 = False. Any numbers except 0 = True.

|  Type  | Sizes in bytes |  Interpretation | Possible Values
|  bool  |     1byte      | True(1)/False(0)| true/false 
|  char  |     1bytes     |    character    | -128 ~ 127 (including 0)
|  short |     2bytes     |     integer     | -32768 ~ 32767
|   int  |     4bytes     |     integer     | -2 billion xxx ~ 2 billion xxx (2^32)
| __int  |     8bytes     |     integer     | countless. 

*bool : 몬스터가 해야 할 일, 하지 말아야 할 일 다 따져서 정해줘야함 
*__int : (오래된 게임 같은 경우 유저들이 돈 21억 이상으로 모았을 때 등에 사용. 
         주로 10억 이상의 값을 표현할 때 사용
